# MLS TreeKEM Architecture - Final Implementation Status

## Project Summary
Successfully implemented a TreeKEM-compliant tree structure for the MLS (Message Layer Security) project at `/home/rileyhalo/Projects/snowmerak/mls`.

## Critical Architectural Understanding
- **Only leaf nodes represent actual users** (리프 노드만 실제 유저)
- **Server manages only public tree structure** - never performs private key operations
- **Clients keep all private keys local** and compute shared secrets using Diffie-Hellman
- **Intermediate nodes are computed collaboratively** between clients using DH key exchange

## Completed Implementation

### Core Files
1. **lib/tree/tree.go** - Interface definitions (unchanged)
2. **lib/tree/disk/tree.go** - Main TreeKEM implementation with:
   - `SetIntermediateNodeKey()` - for client-provided keys
   - `GetTreeStructure()` - for client coordination
   - Modified `Insert()` - creates placeholder intermediate nodes
   - Removed automatic key derivation (critical fix)

3. **lib/tree/disk/client_server_test.go** - Comprehensive 7-step TreeKEM process:
   - Step 1: Client key generation
   - Step 2: Alice joins (leaf node creation)
   - Step 3: Bob joins (intermediate placeholder creation)
   - Step 4: Server sends tree structure to clients
   - Step 5: Clients compute DH shared secret
   - Step 6: Clients send computed public key to server
   - Step 7: Server broadcasts updated tree

### Key Features Implemented
- ✅ Disk-based binary tree with JSON persistence
- ✅ Balanced insertion algorithm
- ✅ TreeKEM-compliant leaf-only user representation
- ✅ Proper client-server separation of concerns
- ✅ Simulated Diffie-Hellman key exchange
- ✅ Public key coordination without private key exposure

## Test Results
All tests passing:
- `TestTreeKEMClientServerCooperation` - Demonstrates complete TreeKEM workflow
- Shows proper cryptographic separation between client and server
- Validates DH computation produces identical results for both parties

## Security Model Validated
- **Server**: Only manages tree structure and coordinates public keys
- **Clients**: Perform all private key operations and DH computations locally
- **Intermediate Nodes**: Created as placeholders, filled by client DH results
- **No Private Key Exposure**: Server never sees or generates private keys

## Architecture Compliance
This implementation correctly follows TreeKEM principles where the server acts as a coordinator for public information while all cryptographic operations requiring private keys happen client-side. The tree serves as a public coordination structure, not a private key generation system.
