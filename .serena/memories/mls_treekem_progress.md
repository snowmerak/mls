# MLS and TreeKEM Implementation Progress

## Project Purpose
This project is implementing MLS (Messaging Layer Security) and TreeKEM for efficient group key management. TreeKEM uses binary tree structures to manage encryption keys in group messaging scenarios.

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Features
1. **Binary Tree Interface** (`lib/tree/tree.go`)
   - Element interface with left/right child navigation
   - Tree interface with Insert, Find, Delete, Head operations
   - Support for node counting (left/right subtree sizes)

2. **Disk-Based Binary Tree Implementation** (`lib/tree/disk/tree.go`)
   - Complete implementation of all interface methods
   - JSON-based persistence to disk
   - Binary Search Tree (BST) structure for efficient operations
   - Proper error handling and file management
   - TreeKEM-compatible node structure with key material storage

### Key Features for TreeKEM
- **Node Storage**: Each node can store arbitrary byte data (encryption keys)
- **Tree Structure**: Maintains BST ordering for efficient lookups
- **Persistence**: All tree data is saved to disk for durability
- **Counting**: Tracks subtree sizes for TreeKEM algorithms
- **File Management**: Automatic file creation/deletion during tree operations

### Test Coverage
- Comprehensive test suite with disk persistence verification
- TreeKEM usage pattern testing
- Binary tree operations (insert, find, delete)
- File system integration testing

## Next Steps for MLS/TreeKEM
1. Implement TreeKEM key derivation algorithms
2. Add group member management
3. Implement ratcheting mechanisms
4. Add cryptographic key operations
5. Implement MLS protocol message handling

## Performance Considerations
- Disk I/O optimized with JSON serialization
- BST structure provides O(log n) operations
- Lazy loading of child nodes for memory efficiency
